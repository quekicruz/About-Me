      <p>Hello, and welcome to my About Me page! I appreciate you taking the time to learn about me so I'll keep it
        brief. It all started the day I was born... No, but seriously, my name is Keian Anthony and I am 20 years old. I
        went to school right out of high school through Everett Community College and completed enough credits for an AA
        in Arts and Science after 2 years. I briefly worked at a TopGolf in 2020, which if you have never been to one,
        its
        basically a glorified driving range. My goals are, since learning to code is my first career-based skill, to
        finish this boot camp and be knowledgable to the point where I can land a career in software development.</p>
